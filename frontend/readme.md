# Team Data Merge Web Application

This web application allows users to retrieve and display merged data from two collections, collection1 and collection2. The application fetches the merged data from the server and dynamically renders it in an HTML table.

### Prerequisites
To use this web application, you need a modern web browser.

#### Usage
* Clone the repository:

      git clone <repository-url>

* Open the index.html file in a web browser.

* Click the "Get All Data" button to retrieve and display the merged team data.

## Implementation Details
* The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* The index.html file defines the structure of the web page and includes the required CSS and JavaScript files.

* The index.js file contains the JavaScript code that fetches the merged data from the server and dynamically renders it in an HTML table.

* When the user clicks the "Get All Data" button, an HTTP request is sent to the server to fetch the merged team data.

* The response from the server is then processed, and the data is displayed in the HTML table.
